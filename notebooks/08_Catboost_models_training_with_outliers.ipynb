    "- **median_absolute_error**: Computes the median of all absolute differences between the target and predicted values. This metric is robust to outliers and gives a better sense of the typical error when outliers are present.\n",

    "- **mean_squared_error (MSE)**: Measures the average of the squares of the errors—that is, the average squared difference between the estimated values and the actual value. It penalizes larger errors more than smaller ones due to squaring.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **mean_squared_log_error (MSLE)**: Similar to MSE but takes the logarithm of the predictions and actual values. It is useful when you want to penalize underestimation more than overestimation and is less sensitive to large errors than MSE.\n",

    "- **custom metrics**: Compute the percentage of times that the error falls less than some threshold. This may correlate with customer satisfaction, if they are for example happy if there's less than a 5% rate, this would count the percentage of happy customers. Of course, this will need further study (for example, segmenting the score)"
